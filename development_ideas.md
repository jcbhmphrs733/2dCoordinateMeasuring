# Development Ideas
## To Do:

- [ ] Multi-Point Circle (avg dia, max dia, min dia).
- [ ] Create two tangent lines from a given circle and point.
- [ ] Circle intersections.
- [ ] Distance between circles (max dist, min dist, center to center dist).
- [ ] Construct parallel line given a line and a point.
- [ ] Construct a line that bisects two lines.
- [ ] Dist line to line (width).
- [ ] Construct circumcircle and inscribed circle given three circles with varying radii.
- [ ] World allignment (single line, line and a point, two lines)
